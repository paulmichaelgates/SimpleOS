This folder contains task definitions that allow tools to be used in vscode. 

Project is independent of any IDE, but these definitions are useful for understanding how specific 
tools are used within the project as well. 

The tasks.json file contains the basic commands used during development. E.g., to start the gdb
server, create a debug build, etc.
